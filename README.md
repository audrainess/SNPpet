Welcome to SNPpet!

SNPpet is a genomic notation conversion tool that reformats genomic coordinates (e.g. input chr14:74551659-7466819) for subsequent queries in popular medical genetics databases, such as Franklin, UCSC Genome Browser, ClinVar, and gnomAD. 

The available files are for incorporating this logic into a website; the pilot is currently hosted at https://sea-lion-app-ovjwk.ondigitalocean.app/.

The UCSC Genome Browser LiftOver function is also embedded to allow for easy conversion between GR37/hg19 and GR38/hg38 versions of the human reference genome. 

Happy genomic converting!
